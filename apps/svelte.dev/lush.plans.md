# plans

[branches](./branches.md) are docs
for the specific branches to implement
the plans ofr the [lush](./lush.md) project.
This doc will be more a less speciffic bird view unlike the `branches` doc.

Some parts of the plan will deal with forks of other repos than `svelte.dev`.
Deno 2 supports FFI so the rust based regex implementation will be 
mutated to support raku like regexen.

# focuses of the moment

- integrating the current docs into the omnisite. 
- a unparsing of pure html unparsing of the ast generated for vanilla `.svelte` into `.lush`
