# lush.svelte.dev

This doc is about the integration of lush in the omnisite `svelte.dev`. We will
denote the existing site by `svelte.dev` and our forked site by
`lush.svelte.dev`, or either by `*.svelte.dev`.

Probably one of the first task will be to integrate the lush docs in the docs of
svelte.dev.

## routes

the best way to document `*.svelte.dev` is doing it by routes.

## docs/[...path]

the route for docs, obviously. Need to explore and integrates the lush docs.
