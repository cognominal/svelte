I attempt to create a filetree component that is inspired from the tutorial by stealing and adpating its code.
Also the look and feel should be like vscode.

The route to acess this experiment is /RouteExporer.

Goals : 
  * support sticky headers. Current experiment : https://svelte.dev/playground/c8dcf3712f4f42b58735c337e6380a5e?version=5.11.0
  * use chokidar to watch for changes in the visible parts of the filtetree
